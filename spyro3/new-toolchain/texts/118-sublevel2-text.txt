Will you please help me perform my ice dance? These mean rhynoc hockey players keep hogging the ice and all I want to do is dance. &Protect dancer from evil hockey players? &Yes. &No.

Thanks! Let's go!

Uh...that's OK. I don't mind getting beaten to a pulp over and over by a bunch of vicious hockey players. I'm sure you have more important things to do anyway.

That's OK, it didn't hurt as much as it looked. Let's try again! &Try again? &Yes. &No.

We did it! That was my best performance ever! I guess one of the judges didn't like it, though. He threw this egg at me instead of a rose. Why don't you have it.

Maybe you can be my ice dancing partner in the next Olympics!

Fine. I'll just wait for some other dragon to come along.

Do you want to try again? &Try again? &Yes. &No.

Tonight is my big ice dance performance, and these hockey players are ruining it! Every time I start my routine, they come in and smack me with their sticks. Oh, I sure wish I had a partner... someone courageous and strong and handsome and... purple... who breathes fire...
